# Fancy Weather Apis

# Description 
 This site was designed to show the current and upcoming weather in a given city, and save your recent searches to a list (and your local storage) for easy access. It displays the temperature, an icon representing the weather, wind speed, and humidity in a given city. The framework used was fomantic UI, and the apis were provided by openweather. I set the apis to work with only American cities as to avoid confusing the api with what country was intended.
